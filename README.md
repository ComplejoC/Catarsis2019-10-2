Data and graphs for student/administrator meeting

THe meeting took place on the second of october 2019 where graduate students aired out their concerns about how their stepends are being handle. The contents of this repository include the results of two anonymous surveys filed out by UPRRP Natural Sciences students and the code I used to analize the data.

In the Spirit of being 100% tranparent I'm making the data and code public so anyone can replicate my findings.
